# about

wava is a commandline audio visualizer for Pulseaudio (ALSA coming soon) that is heavily inspired by [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava). however, instead of visualizing
audio with bars like cava and many other visualizers, wava focuses on creating aesthetic scenes by using colors and shapes 
that react to characteristics of the sounds being played like pitch and amplitude.

**WARNING**: **wava can produce a lot of flashing lights and colors that may be unsuitable for individuals with epilepsy.**

# installation

for Arch systems, there is an AUR available here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wava-git

to build from source, wava requires FFTW, libconfig, and Pulseaudio/ALSA dev files.

to install all required dependenecies on Debian/Ubuntu systems, simply run
```
sudo apt-get install -y libpulse-dev libasound2-dev libfftw3-dev libconfig++-dev
```
in your terminal.

i am not familiar with installing dependencies on other systems, but i believe these commands should work:

Fedora

```
dnf install alsa-lib-devel fftw3-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel libconfig-devel libtool
```

openSUSE

```
zypper install alsa-devel fftw3-devel libpulse-devel libtool libconfig-devel
```

after dependencies are installed, run
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/wava 
cp -p ./config/wava.cfg ~/.config/wava/
make
sudo make install
```
in the cloned repo to install wava.

to uninstall, run
```
rm -rf ~/.config/wava
sudo make uninstall
```
in the cloned repo. 

by default, wava is installed to `/usr/local/bin/`. if you would like to change that, run
```
make install PREFIX=<desired dir>
```
and make sure to use the same prefix for `make uninstall`.

# usage

upon starting wava, you will be greeted with a black screen because nothing is rendered by default.
in this state, only the background will respond to audio being played. briefly play something and verify the background changes color to make sure a connection was properly established to the audio server. 

out of the box, the way the background responds to audio may require some tweaking to match your preference. to that end, wava supports keybinds for decreasing/increasing the noise gate (`c`/`v`), decreasing/increasing brightness (`b`/`n`), and decreasing/increasing the decay rate (`j`/`k`). 

generally speaking, if the background is not responding to sounds, you want to **decrease** the noise gate. if the colors are too bright and immediately forming white, **decrease** the brightness. if the colors are changing too quickly, **decrease** the decay rate (and vice versa).


if the window is too small or big, you can also change its size with the arrow keys.


now that the background is configured to your liking, you can start adding shapes. to add a shape, press `1`, `2`, or `3` on your keyboard to generate a donut, a sphere, and a cube respectively. additionally, to increase real-time audio responsiveness, wava renders shapes with reduced detail by default. to increase/decrease detail along the x-axis for spheres and donuts, press `q`/`a`. to increase/detail along the y-axis, press `w`/`s`. to increase/detail for cubes, press `e`/`d`. 

wava has a range of color palettes that can be assigned to the background and individual shapes. to change the background color palette, press `z`/`x`. the name of the palette should appear under the rendering window. in order to change the palette of individual shapes, you must change to highlight mode.

wava has two modes to make better use of the keyboard. the first is normal mode in which you can generate new shapes and how they are rendered, change background colors, change audio responsiveness settings, and read from/write to a config file. the second mode is "highlight" mode, in which you can select individual shapes and change their characteristics like color, size, and position on the screen. in order to change to highlight mode, have at least one shape on screen and press `H`. if it changed successfully, you should see "HIGHLIGHT MODE" under the render window.

now one of the shapes on screen should be a different colorâ€”this means that it is selected and you can change its individual characteristics. to change its palette, press `z`/`x` like you did to change the background palette. again, the name of the palette should appear below the rendering window. you can also increase or decrease its size by pressing the up arrow and down arrow keys respectively, and you can change its position with the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys. 

to change which shape is being selected, press the left or right arrow keys. to delete the selected shape, press `D`.

after you've made the desired changes to your shapes, you can press `N` to change back to normal mode. 

if you really enjoy the scene you've made, you can save to the config file with `W`. if you would like to reload to your previously saved scene, press `R`.

once you're done using wava, press `ESC` to exit (exiting forcefully is not recommended because it can require a restart of the pulseaudio server).

that is pretty much all you need to know to use wava. the next section has an entire list of the keybinds

# keybinds

**normal AND highlight mode:**

`m` - enable/disable response to audio

`ESC` - quit wava

`h` - turn on/off description below window

**normal mode:**

`W` - write to config

`R` - read from config

`1` - add donut

`2` - add sphere

`3` - add cube

arrow keys - change size of window

`c`/`v` - decrease/increase noise gate

`b`/`n` - decrease/increase brightness

`j`/`k` - decrease/increase decay rate

`z`/`x` - change background palette

`a`/`q` - decrease/increase phi detail (affects spheres and donuts)

`w`/`s` - decrease/increase theta detail (affects spheres and donuts)

`e`/`d` - decrease/increase prism detail (affects cubes)

`f`/`r` - decrease/increase light smoothness

`H` - change to highlight mode

**highlight mode:**

`UP_ARROW`/`DOWN_ARROW` - decrease/increase size of selected shape

`LEFT_ARROW`/`RIGHT_ARROW` - change which shape is selected

`z`/`x` - change palette of selected shape

`w`/`a`/`s`/`d` - change position of selected shape

`D` - delete selected shape

`N` - change back to normal mode
